	<h1>The Mediocrity of the Jason Garrett Era</h1>
	<img src = "https://thelandryhat.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/129/files/2014/10/jason-garrett-nfl-dallas-cowboys-seattle-seahawks7.jpg" alt = 'Jason Garrett "The Clapper"'>
	<p>
		There is no better example of a mediocrity in the NFL, and even in life, than the one and only Jason Garrett. A man who is better known for his clapping abilities, than his coaching abilities. Over his 8 year career, Garrett has an overall win - loss record of 67-53. That doesn't sound that bad. However, if we take out his 1st half season as the Cowboys head coach (he took over for Wade Phillips 8 games into the season). Also, if we just take out the last two years with the emergence of rookie sensations, Ezekiel Elliot and Dak Prescott, Garrett's record is a perfect 40-40. That doesn't win championships, Mr. Jerry Jones. In conclusion, fire his ass!
